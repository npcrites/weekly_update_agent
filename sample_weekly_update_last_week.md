## Headlines

The team is continuing to crush it – we started internal testing on Jobs Report improvements and haven't found any issues; should go live soon. We're seeing a ~5x reduction in avg. response time.

We're making good progress on the AI SDLC work. The Kiro bot is able to publish small MRs, but we're doing work to reduce the amount of AI slop produced.

Migration-wise, two things are happening: mapping the most basic job types is in progress, and I've had some good conversations on the product side around Landscape/Design-Build migration. Building consensus that the job action component in the job detail drop-down is where we'll take our next big UI swing.

## This Week

**On-site:** Really liked being on-site and already feel more connected to the broader org.

**Planning:** We have some capacity outside of must-haves for retention or to keep customers happy. We've been focusing a lot on run & maintain, and there's still a question of whether it's worth doubling down here with a move to LMN in mind or investing in new features (e.g. job detail page). Would love to hear your thoughts.

**AI SDLC:** Lots here – I got buy-in from the team on starting to ship smaller one-pointers, and I'm pretty pumped to flex that muscle and move more quickly as a team.

**Data Exports:** There are some open questions about how / when / if we should be offering these to customers. My theory is that they're plugging this data into ChatGPT, but just a theory.

## Next Week

**Performance:** We'll wrap up dev on job management performance and get ready for internal testing. I want to try to get more buy-in for internal testing this time since it's a bigger change.

**Planning:** Would love to get your thoughts on our roadmap and medium-term approach.

**Migration:** Setting up the big meeting with everyone on a biweekly cadence; going to start demoing LMN to SO customers. Camp is meeting with Steve Fox / Katie to discuss next best steps (I'll be OOO).

**AI SDLC:** Got connected to Jira and Glean MCP in Cursor. I'm thinking I'll build a research agent, prioritization agent, and refinement agent for the team. I'd love to hook it up to ProductBoard but I think it requires a Zapier integration as they don't have MCP.
